== Motors vs Encoders ==
This data shows how far (in encoder ticks) the motors will move the robot for various motor velocities (motor_set_vel). It is valuable for dead-reckoning because encoder ticks can be converted to distances in VPS units. It also shows the effects of friction on the motors, giving a motor velocity below which the robot will not move.
